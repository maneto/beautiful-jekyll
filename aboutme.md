My name is Henrique, but you can call me Neto. I am a tech addicted, a support analyst at TRE-PR and a wannabe web developer whose interests are:

- *nix-like systems;
- open source technologies;
- conspiracy theories;
- beer and
- coding for fun.


### my history

I am a sagitarious who was born in the beginning of the end of the year 1980. I started dealing with computers when I was 11 yo and, after using MS operational systems as MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, 3.11, 95, 98, XP and 7, and some Linux flavour systems including Kubuntu 5.10 and Ubuntu from 6.04 to 13.04, and Android for some time with some tricks as I rooted and installed several ROMs, I am a macOS X and iOS user right now.<!-- [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.-->
